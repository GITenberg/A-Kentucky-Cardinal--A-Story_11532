description: Though the American South played an important role in contributing to
  the country's culture, it wasn't until the mid-nineteenth century that a distinctly
  Southern literary voice began to emerge. Kentucky-based author James Lane Allen's
  gift for description and unforgettable characters helped him rise to prominence
  among the ""local color"" literary movement in the South, and his prodigious talents
  are on full display in the novella A Kentucky Cardinal.
